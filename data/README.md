**We divide our machine learning task into two branches based on the available datasets(limited), namely classification and regression problems (prediction).**

*Regression task*




* We used the preoperative scale score of each patient as a label to train a regression model on the training set, which was then used to predict the patient's label on the testing set. We store all the labels used in the regression task (both training and testing sets) in the **data_y_regression.csv** file.



*Classification task*
